## TL;DR
A new video representation by (i) a canonical image that aggregates the static contents and (ii) a temporal deformation field that reconstructs the video frames when applied to the static image.

## Problem statements
Video processing comes at a high cost,and naively processing frames results in poor cross-frame consistency.

## Method

**High level objective.** The proposed representations should have the following characteristics:
* Fitting capability for faithful video reconstruction.
* Semantic correctness of the canonical image to ensure the performance of image processing algorithms.
* Smoothness of the deformation field to guarantee temporal consistency and correct propagation.

**Model.** The model consists of a 2D hash-based canonical image field (*C*) coupled with a 3D hash-based temporal deformation field (*D*). 
An arbitrary position *x* in the *t*-th frame is first encoded by a 3D hash encoding function *γ3D(x, t)* to get high-dimension multi-resolution features. 
Then a tiny MLP maps the embedded features its corresponding position in canonical field 
*(γ3D(x, t)) → x′*.

**Multiple deformation files.** For videos featuring large occlusions, additional layers corresponding to multiple content deformation fields are used. These layers would be defined based on semantic segmentation (using the Segment-Anything-track method).
Each semantic layer is associated with a mask.
For each layer, a group of canonical fields and deformation fields represent the separate motion of different objects.

**Training loss.** The representation is trained by minimizing the L2 loss between the ground truth color and the predicted color for a given coordinate in addition to multiple regularization terms.

## Limitations
Each the mode needs to be train per a specific video. The training duration is approximately 5 minutes when utilizing 100
video frames (3 second video).

Unable to manage diverse videos that cannot be represented by a canonical image.
