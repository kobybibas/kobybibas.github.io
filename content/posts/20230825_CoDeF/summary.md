## TL;DR


## Problem statements


## Method


## Limitations
We train an implicit deformable model tailored to fit these frames.
he average training
duration is approximately 5 minutes when utilizing 100
video frames. It should be noted that the training time varies
with several factors such as the length of the video, the
type of motion, and the number of layers.
